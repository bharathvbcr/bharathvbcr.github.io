## üî≠ What I'm Currently Focused On

As an **Associate Researcher at the Adidas-ASU Center for Engagement Science**, my work is centered on understanding the intricate relationship between sensory feedback and human performance.

- üß† **Investigating** the impact of somatosensory feedback (via textured footwear) on cognitive and motor performance in athletes.
- üî¨ **Developing and implementing** novel mixed-methods research protocols to assess biomechanical and cognitive responses during dynamic activities.
- üí° **Pioneering** new assessment techniques, like the Dynamic Auditory Stroop Test (DAST), to quantify cognitive load in real-world scenarios.
